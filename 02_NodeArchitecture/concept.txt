Blocking operations (syncronous operations)
Non-Blocking operations (asynchronous operations)

client request and goes to node server in event Queue
Event loop check the operation type 
---> if non-blocking then  process it and send response to user 
---> If blocking operation then goes to Thread Pool (pool of threads (workers) responsible of fullfiling blocking operations)
 
PROBLEM IN BLOCKING OPERATIONS

---> limited threads , by default 4
---> if 5th user comes it will wait (4 workers working)
---> server can take alot of time in case of many users
So, good practice to write non-blocking code
